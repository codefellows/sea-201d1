var data = [...] --- this is the data for the chart

var images = [] --- empty array to hold images objects

var files = [...] --- array of filenames

function Photo(name, path) --- constructor for photo objects

function buildPhoto() --- turns filenames into new image objects



----------tracker_object----------

var tracker = {...} --- object that manages the behaviors of the user interaction

    tracker.left: empty string to hold image object
    tracker.right: empty string to hold image object

    tracker.leftImageEl: DOM location
    tracker.rightImageEl: DOM location

    tracker.getRandomNum() --- generates a random number between 0 and images.length

    tracker.getRandomImg() --- displays two random images and prevents duplicates

    tracker.vote(id) --- checks which image was clicked against the names in the 'images' array and then increments the vote tally on the image that received a click, and pushes the new tally to the data array used by the chart

----------end_tracker_object----------



var ctx = DOM location for chart

var chart = new Chart --- creates chart and assigns options

var mainContent = DOM element where images and chart live

mainContent.addEventListener() --- handles click events on the DOM and does the following:
 * calls tracker.vote(id)
 * calls tracker.getRandomImg()
 * calls chart.update()
